# Question 1

# They are all objects, and you can find out what class they belong to by calling .class on each of them.

# Question 2

# You can mixin by using the 'include' reserved word to mixin a module to a class. You can then check if that worked by creating a new object from that class and calling object.go_fast on it.

# Question 3

# This is done because of the 'self.class' interpolation on line 3. 'self' will always refer to the object itself (i.e. small_car) and calling the '.class' method on it returns the name of the class it belongs to, which is 'Car'.

# Question 4

# We can create a new instance of a class by typing AngryCat.new

# Question 5

# The class that has an instance variable is Pizza because the variable has an @ symbol before it (you can apparently also call .instance_variables on a object from that class to find out too).

# Question 6

# We could add an attr_accessor or attr_reader tag. Or add an instance method that returns the instance variable.

# Question 7

# By default '.to_s' prints the objects class and an encoding of the object's ID to the console.

# Question 8

# In this example, '.self' refers to the unique instance object itself.

# Question 9

# In this context, in a class method, '.self' refers to the class Cat.

# Question 10

# Bag.new('red', 'cloth') - with 2 arguments.
